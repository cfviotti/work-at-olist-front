# Olist Front-End code challenge
> This is a code challange provided by [Olist](http://olist.com/) for their Front-End candidates. It consists of a signup page with form validation including a password strength feature. More info on the challenge instructions [here](https://github.com/cfviotti/work-at-olist-front/blob/master/CHALLENGE-INSTRUCTIONS.md) 

## Installing / Getting started
Begin by cloning this repo and instaling dependencies
1. `git clone https://github.com/cfviotti/work-at-olist-front`
2. `cd work-at-olist-front`
3. `npm install`

## Developing
### Built With
- [Webpack Config Split]
- [Webpack Development Server]
- [HTML assets + minification]
- [SCSS to CSS + optimizations]
- [ES6 transpiling]
- [Browserslist]
- [Image assets + compression]
- [Font loading + preloading]
- [Asset compression (gzip)]
- [Clean Webpack Plugin]
- [Sourcemaps]
- [Offline-first + caching]
- [Progressive Web App (PWA)]

It uses Webpack to bundle and serve files through Webpack Dev Server.
The project is based on [this boilerplate](https://github.com/tr1s/tris-webpack-boilerplate) by @tr1s and slightly modified by me.

Code is based on HTML5 (heavily making use of native forms validation through the Constraint validation API), JavaScript (ES6) and SASS.

### Prerequisites
You will need [git](https://git-scm.com/) and [node.js](https://nodejs.org/) on your computer before running.


### Setting up Dev
```shell
npm start
```
This will run `webpack.common.js` and `webpack.dev.js` scripts, opening a page at [http://localhost:3000/](http://localhost:3000/) with live reloading functionality.

### Building
```shell
npm run build
```
This will run `webpack.common.js` and `webpack.prod.js` scripts in order to build our files inside a `dist` folder with optmizations for production .

## Style guide

I use [RSCSS](https://rscss.io/index.html) as a SASS naming convention with a few adaptations based on preference, and [ABCSS](https://github.com/co-de-sign/abcss) for organizing the project file structure.

ABCSS is heavily based on [SMACSS](http://smacss.com/) and [ITCSS](https://speakerdeck.com/dafed/managing-css-projects-with-itcss).
It was developed by some local friends of mine, under the [Co-de-sign community](https://www.facebook.com/codesigncommunity/), which host events and meetings (usually at the bar ðŸ™ƒ) with fellow Front-Enders here in BrasÃ­lia - Brazil.

My main adaptation on RSCSS, is to not worry so much with applying classes to **every** element. I believe many of them are already self-describable based on their intended usage (like `section`, `p`, `li`, and many, many others) and can be styled inside [Components](https://rscss.io/components.html) with child rules without the need for classes just to give them "semantic" meaning. 
I also like to think everything is an [Element](https://rscss.io/elements.html) UNTIL it needs to be replicated, which then I decouple it from the original Component creating another one. This approach proved really helpful for developing UIs fast, having other devs not fumbling too much with SASS code while trying to understand verbose naming like [BEM](http://getbem.com/naming/), and most importantly, not worrying about over generalization until needed.

## Work enviroment used
1. KDE Neon 5.16.5 based on Ubuntu 18.04 LTS
2. An older 2012 Lenovo U410 with an Intel i7-3537U @ 2.00GHz, 8GB of RAM
3. Sublime Text 3 with Emmet, JavaScript Enhancements, CSScomb, and BracketHighlighter plugins used extensively

## Demo
This project is deployed through Netlify [here](https://nervous-banach-4136da.netlify.com/)

## Considerations
Originally the challenge orients to disable the submit form button until the form is valid, and enable it after validation. I realized that was not necessary since I'm using native HTML5 form validation through the Constraint Validation API, which already avoids sending forms if they're not valid by checking `required` and `pattern` properties on its child elements. It keeps things much simpler without the need for complex custom JS validation methods. Hope this is all right :)
